# Fincom-Case-study-Competition
My partner and I secured the 2nd position in a case study competition addressing the decline in the profitability ratio of Bank X. We analyzed the issue through a comprehensive approach involving current possibilities, hypothesis formation, and market research. Our solution included developing four prioritized strategies based on feasibility and impact. We utilized detailed analysis techniques to identify the underlying issues and proposed effective solutions to improve the profitability ratio.
